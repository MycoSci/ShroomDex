# Basidiomycota Phylum

Members of the Basidiomycota, commonly known as the club fungi or basidiomycetes, produce meiospores called basidiospores on club-like stalks called basidia. Most common mushrooms belong to this group, as well as rust and smut fungi, which are major pathogens of grains. Other important basidiomycetes include the maize pathogen Ustilago maydis,[166] human commensal species of the genus Malassezia,[167] and the opportunistic human pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans.
