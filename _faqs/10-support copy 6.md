Several highly toxic mushrooms exist, including the death cap (Amanita phalloides), destroying angel (Amanita bisporigera), and the amanita family in general. To avoid poisonous mushrooms, it's crucial to become familiar with their distinctive characteristics, which may include white gills, a sac-like volva at the base of the stem, and a distinctive cap shape. Always consult a reliable field guide or a mycologist when foraging for wild mushrooms, and never rely solely on online information or casual observations to identify them. Remember that misidentifying a poisonous mushroom can have severe consequences, so caution is paramount.
