To extend the freshness of mushrooms, store them in a paper bag or a breathable container in the refrigerator. This helps prevent moisture buildup, which can lead to spoilage. Avoid plastic bags or airtight containers as they can promote condensation and make mushrooms deteriorate more quickly. Use mushrooms within a few days of purchase for the best flavor and texture.
