While mushrooms are not as protein-rich as animal products or legumes, they do contain a modest amount of protein. The protein content varies among different mushroom species but is generally lower than that of meat or beans. However, mushrooms can still contribute to your daily protein intake, especially when incorporated into dishes as part of a balanced diet.
